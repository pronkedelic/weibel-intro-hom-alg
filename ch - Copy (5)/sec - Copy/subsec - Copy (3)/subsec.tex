An element $\bar x$ in
\[H_0(T)=E^0_{0,0}/\im(d^h+d^v)\]
can (after choosing a representative $x$ in the class of $\bar x$) be written as
\[x+\im(d^h+d^v)=x+\im(d^h)+\im(d^v)\]
\[=(x+\im(d^v))+(\im(d^h)+\im(d^v))=(x+\im(d^v))+\im(d^h)/\im(d^v),\]
which is clearly an element of $E^2_{0,0}$.

To see that the sequence
\[H_2(T)\to E^2_{2,0}\overset{d}{\to} E^2_{0,1}\to H_1(T)\to E^2_{1,0}\to0\]
is exact, qwen2.5-coder:1.5b slop begins here: we can use the fact that we have a short exact sequence
