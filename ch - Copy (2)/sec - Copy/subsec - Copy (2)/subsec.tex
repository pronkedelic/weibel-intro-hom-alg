Let $G$ be a covariant $\delta$-functor, and suppose there is a natural transformation $\alpha$ from $G_0$ to $F$. Since $F$ is exact, the map $FA\xra{Ff}FB$ is mono, so \[Ff\circ\alpha_A\circ\delta=0\Lra\alpha_A\circ\delta=0\]

By commutativity of the second square, $Ff\circ\alpha_A\circ\delta=\alpha_B\circ G_0f\circ\delta$, and by exactness of the top row, $\alpha_B\circ G_0f\circ\delta=\alpha_B\circ0=0$, so the first square commutes.

To see that $\alpha$ extends to commute with all $\delta_n$'s,
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
    G_nC \arrow[r, "\delta"] \arrow[d] & G_{n-1}A \arrow[r, "G_{n-1}f"] \arrow[d, "\alpha_A"] & G_{n-1}B \arrow[r] \arrow[d, "\alpha_B"] & G_{n-1}C \arrow[r] \arrow[d, "\alpha_C"] & G_{n-2}A \arrow[d, "0"] \\
    0 \arrow[r, "\delta"]              & 0 \arrow[r]                                          & 0 \arrow[r]                              & 0 \arrow[r]                              & 0                      
    \end{tikzcd}
\]
Note that the first square has a bottom row of 0's.
