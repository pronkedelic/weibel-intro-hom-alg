Let $J$ be an ideal in $R=\bZ/m$, then for some $n$, $J\cong\bZ/n$, and the inclusion $\iota:J\hookrightarrow R$ is the map $1\mapsto\frac{m}{n}$, so there exists a map $\pi$ extending it
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
    R \arrow[rd, "\pi"] &                      &   \\
    0 \arrow[r]         & J \arrow[r, "\iota"] & R
    \end{tikzcd}
\]
with $\pi$ the quotient modulo $n$.

If $d\div m$, and there exists a prime $p$ such that $p\div d$ and $p\div \frac{m}{d}$, then consider $\iota_m,\iota_d$ generated by $\iota_m(1)=\frac{m}{p}$ and $\iota_d(1)=\frac{d}{p}$;
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
    0 \arrow[r] & \mathbb{Z}/p \arrow[r, "\iota_m"] \arrow[d, "\iota_d"] & \mathbb{Z}/m \\
                & \mathbb{Z}/d                                           &             
    \end{tikzcd}
\]
then since $p$ is a prime, and $p\div\frac{m}{d}$, $d\div\frac{m}{p}$, so any map $\bZ/m\ra\bZ/d$ precomposed with $\iota_m$ is 0, and can't be $\iota_d$, which is nonzero. Therefore $\bZ/d$ is not injective.
