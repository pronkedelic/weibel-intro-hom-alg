If $a$ is in the torsion subgroup and of order $n$, then set $f(a)=\frac{1}{n}\in\bQ/\bZ$. Since $\bQ/\bZ$ is injective, $f:a\bZ\ra\bQ/\bZ$ extends to a map $f':A\ra\bQ/\bZ$. If $a$ is free, then there are several nonzero maps from $a\bZ$ to $\bQ/\bZ$ (e.g. $a\mapsto\frac{1}{2}$).

To prove that $e_A$ is an injection, writing the $f'$ assigned to $a$ as $f'_a$, let $a_1,a_2\in A$ be distinct. Then $f'_{a_1}-f'_{a_2}$ is nonzero, because we can choose constants $c_1,c_2\in\bZ$ (depending on the orders of $a_1,a_2$ respectively) such that $(f'_{a_1}-f'_{a_2})(c_1a_1+c_2a_2)=\frac{1}{2}$.
