1$\Lra$2 is obvious because $-\otimes B$ being exact means it preserves SES's, which is equivalent to all the $\Tor_i(A,B)=0$ for $i\ge1$ because $A$ is a part of the SES
\[0\longrightarrow A\xra{\cong}A\longrightarrow0\longrightarrow0\]

$2\Ra3$ is trivial, and $3\Ra1$ is similar to $\mathbf{4\Ra2}$ from \ref{ex2.5.1}. In both cases, I can't really see how the first derived functors being zero means all other derived functors are zero.
